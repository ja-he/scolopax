`WIP`

### Can't this be a shellscript with inotifywait or something?

- yup :^)
- check out [this one in my dotfiles](https://github.com/ja-he/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/watch-dir-run-thing.sh), for example.
    - (feel free to PR other alternative references here)
- the reason to do this in a higher-level language is flexibility when trying to enable more and more complicated behaviour;
  the shellscript is all well and good until you're trying to do that one specific thing and just becomes a pain
